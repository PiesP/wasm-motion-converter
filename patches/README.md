# wasm-webp strict-CSP patch

`wasm-webp@0.1.0.patch` changes the ESM glue used by the application. Its
Emscripten bindings otherwise construct JavaScript functions from strings during
initialization, which the application's CSP rejects. The WebAssembly binary and
package version are unchanged.

The patch uses closures for bound calls and JavaScript method calls, with separate
argument storage for each invocation and the existing wire-type/destructor
contracts. Global lookup uses `globalThis`. Neither the application nor its
deployment headers permit JavaScript `unsafe-eval`.

This follows the static binding approach described by Emscripten's
[`DYNAMIC_EXECUTION=0` guidance](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/settings_reference.html#dynamic-execution).
The patch applies only to the imported ESM build; the unused CommonJS build is
unchanged. Remove it when an upstream release supplies compatible static glue,
after the same checks pass.

`test/unit/config/csp-policy.test.ts` initializes the real WASM module under
Node's `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings`, round-trips distinct RGB frames,
and checks repeated use and argument validation. The browser output-contract
suite forces the WASM fallback under the application's actual CSP and decodes
the resulting animation to verify geometry, color order, and timing. pnpm binds
the exact patch hash in the lockfile and rejects an unapplied patch.
